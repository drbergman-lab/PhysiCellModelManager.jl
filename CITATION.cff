  PhysiCellModelManager.jl (PCMM) is a Julia package for
  managing PhysiCell simulation workflowsâ€”from input
  preparation to output analysis. Using a database-driven
  approach, PCMM organizes simulation inputs, tracks
  parameter values, and manages outputs in a structured
  hierarchy, allowing users to focus on modeling rather than
  bookkeeping. This system supports efficient reuse of
  previously run simulations and simplifies the process of
  extending simulation scripts and campaigns. PCMM enables
  both scripted analysis in Julia and interactive
  visualization in PhysiCell Studio, made simple by its
  structured database design. PCMM also facilitates
  reproducibility by capturing simulation inputs and outputs
  in a centralized database that supports tracking, reuse,
  and extension. Altogether, PCMM reduces the cognitive and
  logistical overhead of agent-based modeling workflows,
  enabling faster iteration, easier collaboration, and a
  clearer path from model development to insight.
